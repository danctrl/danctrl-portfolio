          <p>
            I'm a product-minded technologist with a focus on infrastructure automation,
            containerization, and cybersecurity. Based in Berlin, I run a self-hosted homelab
            powered by Podman on Red Hat Linux, automate workflows, and explore AI-driven tooling.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently studying Business Administration at HWR Berlin, I bring a unique perspective
            that bridges technical systems with business strategy. I believe the best infrastructure
            serves people &ndash; not the other way around.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm looking for a junior role where I can grow as a DevOps engineer while contributing
            real value from day one.
